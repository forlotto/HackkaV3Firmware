# HackkaV3Firmware
This firmware was created to work with Hackka V3 3D Printer.
The settings in firmware are for an inverteded build what is on the bottom normally is on the top instead.
So please note changes to settings will be required if you built your printer as normal.
Someone finally had the same troubles as me and asked for me to release this work so I felt appropriate to share the effort.
This will be essentially left as is to use as you wish.
